# JavaScript Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains my **systematic practice of Data Structures and Algorithms using JavaScript**, focused on **interview readiness for software engineering roles in the US job market**.

The goal of this repo is not just to solve problems, but to:
- Build strong fundamentals
- Write clean, explainable JavaScript solutions
- Understand time and space complexity
- Practice problem-solving patterns used in real interviews

## 🚀 Why JavaScript for DSA?

I use **JavaScript** intentionally because:
- It aligns with my full-stack background (React, Node.js)
- Many US companies allow JavaScript in coding interviews
- It demonstrates strong problem-solving independent of language choice

All solutions are written with **clarity, correctness, and interview-style explanations** in mind.

## 🧠 Problem-Solving Approach

For every problem, I follow this process:
1. Understand the problem and constraints
2. Think of a brute-force solution
3. Optimize using known patterns
4. Implement a clean JavaScript solution
5. Analyze **time and space complexity**
6. Consider edge cases

This mirrors how problems are evaluated in real interviews.
